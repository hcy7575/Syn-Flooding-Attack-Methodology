This project investigates the performance degradation of a web server under a SYN 
Flooding attack, with the target being the official website of the Department of Computer 
Engineering at Cukurova University ( <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>). Preliminary scanning with nmap revealed that 
only ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) were open on the server, both of which became direct 
targets during the simulated attack. The attack phase was carried out using hping3 and nping, which 
were used to craft and send a large number of TCP SYN packets to the open ports, aiming to 
exhaust server resources.
To assess the impact of the attack on the system’s performance, we initially intended to use 
iperf3 and pathrate; however, due to insufficient privileges on the target server, these tools were 
replaced with client-only alternatives: ApacheBench, Siege, and httperf. These tools were used to 
measure key metrics such as request rate, latency, response time, and error rate before and during 
the attack. Additionally, tcpdump was utilized to capture and analyze packet-level data for verifying  
SYN traffic volume and packet loss.
The results indicate a significant decrease in server responsiveness and a dramatic increase 
in packet loss during the attack, confirming the effectiveness of SYN Flooding in degrading web 
service availability. This project highlights the importance of proactive defense mechanisms against 
Denial-of-Service attacks on publicly accessible systems.
1. Introduction
In today's digital landscape, web servers serve as critical infrastructure for delivering 
services and information to users worldwide. Ensuring the performance and resilience of these 
systems under both normal and adverse conditions is vital for maintaining service availability and 
user satisfaction. This project aims to evaluate the performance and robustness of the Computer 
Engineering Department's public website, hosted at <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>, by applying both benchmarking  
and stress-testing methodologies.
Initially, tools such as httperf, iperf3, and pathrate were selected for measuring 
throughput, latency, and bandwidth characteristics. However, due to limited access and 
insufficient privileges on the remote server , alternatives such as ApacheBench (ab)  and Siege 
were utilized to simulate realistic HTTP traffic under controlled load conditions. These tools 
enabled detailed observation of the web server’s behavior under increasing client connection rates 
and request volumes.
To assess how the system responds under attack scenarios, SYN Flooding was carried out as 
a form of Denial-of-Service (DoS) simulation. Tools like hping3 and nping were employed to 
generate large volumes of SYN packets targeting the web server’s open HTTP (port 80) and 
HTTPS (port 443)  services. Packet-level behavior during the tests was monitored and verified 
using tcpdump, allowing the detection of packet loss, response times, and signs of service 
degradation.
Additionally, nmap was used for preliminary reconnaissance to identify open ports and 
potential exposure points on the server. The scan revealed that only ports 80 and 443 were open to 
the public, focusing the scope of the testing activities on the web service components of the system.
1\n\n--- PAGE 3 ---\nBy combining load testing and offensive security techniques, this project not only evaluates 
the server’s baseline performance but also demonstrates its vulnerability to basic DoS tactics. The 
results highlight the importance of proactive system hardening and monitoring, especially for 
publicly accessible academic infrastructures.
2. Attack Description
This section describes both the history and the technical basis of the SYN flooding attack.
2.1. History
The TCP SYN flooding weakness was discovered as early as 1994 by Bill Cheswick and 
Steve Bellovin [B96]. They included, and then removed, a paragraph on the attack in their book 
"Firewalls and Internet Security: Repelling the Wily Hacker" [CB94]. Unfortunately, no 
countermeasures were developed within the next two years. [1]
The SYN flooding attack was first publicized in 1996, with the release of a description and 
exploit tool in Phrack Magazine [P48-13]. Aside from some minor inaccuracies, this article is of 
high enough quality to be useful, and code from the article was widely distributed and used. [2]
By September of 1996, SYN flooding attacks had been observed in the wild. Particularly, an  
attack against one ISP's mail servers caused well-publicized outages. CERT quickly released an 
advisory on the attack [CA-96.21]. SYN flooding was particularly serious in comparison to other 
known denial-of-service attacks at the time. Rather than relying on the common brute-force tactic of  
simply exhausting the network's resources, SYN flooding targets end-host resources, which require 
fewer packets to deplete. [3]
The community quickly developed many widely differing techniques for preventing or 
limiting the impact of SYN flooding attacks. Many of these have been deployed to varying degrees 
on the Internet, in both end hosts and intervening routers. Some of these techniques have become 
important pieces of the TCP implementations in certain operating systems, although some 
significantly diverge from the TCP specification and none of these techniques have yet been 
standardized or sanctioned by the IETF process. [4]
2.2. Theory of Operation
As described in RFC 793, a TCP implementation may allow the LISTEN state to be entered 
with either all, some, or none of the pair of IP addresses and port numbers specified by the 
application. In many common applications like web servers, none of the remote host's information 
is pre-known or preconfigured, so that a connection can be established with any client whose details  
are unknown to the server ahead of time. This type of "unbound" LISTEN is the target of SYN 
flooding attacks due to the way it is typically implemented by operating systems. [5]
For success, the SYN flooding attack relies on the victim host TCP implementation's 
behavior. In particular, it assumes that the victim allocates state for every TCP SYN segment when 
it is received, and that there is a limit on the amount of such state than can be kept at any time. The 
current base TCP specification, RFC 793 [RFC0793], describes the standard processing of 
incoming SYN segments. RFC 793 describes the concept of a Transmission Control Block (TCB) 
2\n\n--- PAGE 4 ---\ndata structure to store all the state information for an individual connection. In practice, operating 
systems may implement this concept rather differently, but the key is that each TCP connection 
requires some memory space. [6]
Per RFC 793, when a SYN is received for a local TCP port where a connection is in the 
LISTEN state, then the state transitions to SYN-RECEIVED, and some of the TCB is initialized 
with information from the header fields of the received SYN segment. In practice, many operating 
systems do not alter the TCB in LISTEN, but instead make a copy of the TCB and perform the state  
transition and update on the copy. This is done so that the local TCP port may be shared amongst 
several distinct connections. This TCB-copying behavior is not actually essential for this purpose, 
but influences the way in which applications that wish to handle multiple simultaneous connections 
through a single TCP port are written. The crucial result of this behavior is that, instead of updating 
already-allocated memory, new (or unused) memory must be devoted to the copied TCB. [7]
As an example, in the Linux 2.6.10 networking code, a "sock" structure is used to implement  
the TCB concept. By examination, this structure takes over 1300 bytes to store in memory. In other 
systems that implement less-complex TCP algorithms and options, the overhead may be less, 
although it typically exceeds 280 bytes [SKK+97]. [8]
To protect host memory from being exhausted by connection requests, the number of TCB 
structures that can be resident at any time is usually limited by operating system kernels. Systems 
vary on whether limits are globally applied or local to a particular port number. There is also 
variation on whether the limits apply to fully established connections as well as those in SYN-
RECEIVED. Commonly, systems implement a parameter to the typical listen() system call that 
allows the application to suggest a value for this limit, called the backlog. When the backlog limit is  
reached, then either incoming SYN segments are ignored, or uncompleted connections in the 
backlog are replaced. The concept of using a backlog is not described in the standards documents, 
so the failure behavior when the backlog is reached might differ between stacks (for instance, TCP 
RSTs might be generated). The exact failure behavior will determine whether initiating hosts 
continue to retransmit SYN segments over time, or quickly cease. These differences in 
implementation are acceptable since they only affect the behavior of the local stack when its 
resources are constrained, and do not cause interoperability problems. [9]
The SYN flooding attack does not attempt to overload the network's resources or the end 
host's memory, but merely attempts to exhaust the backlog of half-open connections associated with  
a port number. The goal is to send a quick barrage of SYN segments from IP addresses (often 
spoofed) that will not generate replies to the SYN-ACKs that are produced. By keeping the backlog 
full of bogus half-opened connections, legitimate requests will be rejected. Three important attack 
parameters for success are the size of the barrage, the frequency with which barrages are generated, 
and the means of selecting IP addresses to spoof. [10]
A. Barrage Size
To be effective, the size of the barrage must be made large enough to reach the backlog. 
Ideally, the barrage size is no larger than the backlog, minimizing the volume of traffic the attacker 
must source. Typical default backlog values vary from a half-dozen to several dozen, so the attack 
might be tailored to the particular value determined by the victim host and application. On machines  
3\n\n--- PAGE 5 ---\nintended to be servers, especially for a high volume of traffic, the backlogs are often 
administratively configured to higher values.  [11]
B. Barrage Frequency
To limit the lifetime of half-opened connection state, TCP implementations commonly 
reclaim memory from half-opened connections if they do not become fully opened after some time 
period. For instance, a timer of 75 seconds [SKK+97] might be set when the first SYN-ACK is sent,  
and on expiration cause SYN-ACK retransmissions to cease and the TCB to be released. The TCP 
specifications do not include this behavior of giving up on connection establishment after an 
arbitrary time. Some purists have expressed that the TCP implementation should continue 
retransmitting SYN and SYN-ACK segments without artificial bounds (but with exponential 
backoff to some conservative rate) until the application gives up. Despite this, common operating 
systems today do implement some artificial limit on half-open TCB lifetime. For instance, backing 
off and stopping after a total of 511 seconds can be observed in 4.4 BSD-Lite [Ste95], and is still 
practiced in some operating systems derived from this code. [12]
To remain effective, a SYN flooding attack needs to send new barrages of bogus connection 
requests as soon as the TCBs from the previous barrage begin to be reclaimed. The frequency of 
barrages are tailored to the victim TCP implementation's TCB reclamation timer. Frequencies 
higher than needed source more packets, potentially drawing more attention, and frequencies that 
are too low will allow windows of time where legitimate connections can be established. [13]
C. IP Address Selection
For an effective attack, it is important that the spoofed IP addresses be unresponsive to the 
SYN-ACK segments that the victim will generate. If addresses of normal connected hosts are used, 
then those hosts will send the victim a TCP reset segment that will immediately free the 
corresponding TCB and allow room in the backlog for legitimate connections to be made. The code 
distributed in the original Phrack article used a single source address for all spoofed SYN segments.  
This makes the attack segments somewhat easier to identify and filter. A strong attacker will have a 
list of unresponsive and unrelated addresses that it chooses spoofed source addresses from.  [14]
It is important to note that this attack is directed at particular listening applications on a host,  
and not the host itself or the network. The attack also attempts to prevent only the establishment of 
new incoming connections to the victim port, and does not impact outgoing connection requests, 
nor previously established connections to the victim port. [15]
In practice, an attacker might choose not to use spoofed IP addresses, but instead to use a 
multitude of hosts to initiate a SYN flooding attack. For instance, a collection of compromised hosts  
under the attacker's control (i.e., a "botnet") could be used. In this case, each host utilized in the 
attack would have to suppress its operating system's native response to the SYN-ACKs coming 
from the target. It is also possible for the attack TCP segments to arrive in a more continuous 
fashion than the "barrage" terminology used here suggests; as long as the rate of new SYNs exceeds  
the rate at which TCBs are reaped, the attack will be successful.  [16]
4\n\n--- PAGE 6 ---\n3. Project Scope and Ethical Consideration
This project aims to evaluate the resilience of the Computer Engineering Department's 
website, specifically hosted at <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC> or ceng.<REDACTED_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC>, against SYN flooding attacks. The 
attack simulations were carried out using nping and hping3 tools to generate SYN packets. To 
measure the impact of these attacks on server performance, three analysis tools— httperf, iperf, and 
pathrate—were initially assigned by the supervising academician, Doç. Dr. Fatih Abut . However, 
since both iperf and pathrate require simultaneous execution on both the sender and the target 
server, and due to the fact that the target server was not under administrative control, it was not 
feasible to use these tools in this specific context. Instead, alternative tools such as ApacheBench 
(ab) and Siege were employed to perform equivalent performance measurements. These tools 
provided sufficient insight into the server's responsiveness and behavior under attack conditions. 
The scope of the project was strictly limited to SYN flooding attacks ; other forms of DoS or DDoS  
attacks—such as UDP flood or HTTP flood—were explicitly excluded. Additionally, tcpdump was 
used to monitor and capture network traffic during the attack scenarios, allowing for detailed 
inspection of the SYN packet flow and server responses. All necessary permissions were obtained 
from Doç. Dr. Fatih Abut , and the entire project was conducted within a controlled and ethical 
framework under his supervision.
This project was conducted with full ethical responsibility and transparency. All necessary 
permissions and approvals were obtained by the project supervisor, Doç. Dr. Fatih Abut , prior to 
the execution of any testing activities. Throughout the entire process, no harm was inflicted on the 
targeted website, and the integrity or confidentiality of any data hosted on the site was neither 
compromised nor violated. The attacks were carried out solely for academic and research purposes, 
within the ethical boundaries defined by the supervising academic. To ensure transparency and 
accountability, the project’s progress was reviewed weekly in coordination with Doç. Dr. Fatih 
Abut. During these reviews, the ongoing work was assessed, improvements were suggested, and 
necessary adjustments were made. Each week's work and developments were documented in 
regular progress reports, which were shared directly with the supervisor. These measures ensured 
that the project remained ethically sound and aligned with academic standards at all times.
4. Components and Tools
4.1. Target System
The target of the experiment was the Computer Engineering Department's website, hosted at  
<REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC> or ceng.<REDACTED_DOMAIN_SPECIFIC>. Since the server was not administratively controlled by the 
researcher, no changes or configurations could be applied on the server-side. The site was only 
accessed as a black-box target, and care was taken to ensure that neither data confidentiality nor 
service availability was compromised. The attacks were performed in a controlled, authorized 
manner with prior consent from the responsible academic.
4.2. Attack Platform
The SYN flooding attacks were carried out from a laptop running Ubuntu, connected to the 
internet via Wi-Fi. The attacking machine was configured with appropriate privileges to generate 
5\n\n--- PAGE 7 ---\nand send custom network packets. Packet generation and manipulation were conducted within the 
bounds of the test environment, and the attack traffic was monitored locally. The attacker device 
also ran traffic capture and load simulation tools to analyze the impact of the SYN floods on the 
target server.
4.3. Tools Used
Several network tools were utilized throughout the project to simulate attacks and monitor 
server behavior. nping and hping3 were used to generate SYN flooding traffic with custom packet 
flags. To identify open ports and potential attack vectors, nmap was used for port scanning. For 
performance testing, although iperf and pathrate were initially planned, the inability to run these 
tools on both the client and server side led to their replacement. Instead, ApacheBench (ab)  and 
siege were used to evaluate how the server handled HTTP load under stress. Additionally, tcpdump 
was used to capture and analyze network traffic at the packet level during the attacks.
5. Pre-Attack Network Performance
5.1. Httperf
Performance testing was conducted using the httperf tool to evaluate the web server hosted 
at IP address <REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>. Tests were carried out on both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) 
services under varying connection loads and request rates.
A. HTTPS Basic Test (Port 443)
In the first test, a total of 100 connections were established with a rate of 10 connections per 
second and a timeout of 5 seconds. The server successfully responded to all requests with HTTP 
2xx status codes, indicating full availability and no errors under light load. The average connection 
time was approximately 524.8 ms, with a response time of 322.8 ms. The test showed that the 
HTTPS service handles basic traffic efficiently and without issues.
B. HTTPS Stress Test (Port 443)
A second test was performed with a higher load: 1000 connections at a rate of 50 
connections per second. The test duration was approximately 37.7 seconds. The server was able to 
respond to all connections, but 35 of the responses were HTTP 5xx errors, indicating internal server  
issues under pressure. The average connection and response times increased to around 10 seconds, 
demonstrating that server performance degrades under heavier traffic, with noticeable delays and 
occasional failures.
C. Concurrent HTTPS Requests (Port 443)
This test simulated concurrency using bursts of requests. A total of 200 connections were 
made, each issuing 5 HTTP requests with a burst length of 10. Although 1000 total HTTP requests 
were issued, only 274 responses were received. 196 requests timed out. While the responses that 
were received were successful (all 2xx), the high number of timeouts suggests the server struggled 
to handle simultaneous requests, likely due to limited processing or network resources.
6\n\n--- PAGE 8 ---\nD. Basic HTTP Test (Port 80)
The HTTP test on port 80 involved 100 connections at a rate of 10 per second. Although all 
connections were established, only 20% of the responses returned a 2xx success status code, while 
the remaining 80% were 5xx errors. This indicates that the HTTP service encountered significant 
issues even under light traffic conditions, possibly due to misconfiguration or instability in the 
HTTP service.
E. High-Load HTTP Test (Port 80)
A more intensive test with 2000 HTTP connections at a rate of 200 per second further 
confirmed the instability of the HTTP service. While all connections were established, only 1% of 
the responses were successful (2xx), and 99% were server errors (5xx). This indicates that the 
HTTP service failed almost completely under high load, with the server being unable to process the 
incoming traffic correctly.
F. Overall Assessment of Httperf Results
The HTTPS service on port 443 demonstrated relatively stable performance under low to 
moderate loads, although some degradation occurred under stress. In contrast, the HTTP service on 
port 80 returned a high number of 5xx errors, even under minimal traffic, indicating a serious 
performance or configuration issue. Concurrent request handling over HTTPS also led to significant  
timeouts, revealing limitations in handling simultaneous connections. Overall, HTTPS is the more 
reliable protocol on this server, while HTTP requires further investigation and optimization.

A. HTTPS Benchmark – Low Load (500 requests, 10 concurrency)
In the low-traffic HTTPS test (ab -n 500 -c 10), 500 requests were sent to an nginx/1.18.0 
server over TLS 1.3. Out of these, 249 requests failed due to content length mismatches, possibly 
indicating server response issues under concurrency.
The test lasted about 52.76 seconds, with an average of 9.48 requests per second. Average 
request time was 1055 ms (105.5 ms per concurrent request), and transfer rate was 469.73 KB/s. 
Connection time averaged 82 ms, processing time 956 ms, and total request time 1038 ms, with a 
max of 2433 ms.
Half the requests completed within 1044 ms, and 95% within 1592 ms, showing relatively 
stable latency despite the failures, which suggest potential performance or configuration problems 
to investigate.
B. HTTP Benchmark – Low Load (500 requests, 50 concurrency)
An HTTP benchmark test was conducted using ApacheBench ( ab -n 500 -c 50 
http://<REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>/ ) to evaluate server performance under moderate concurrency. The test 
completed 500 requests in approximately 1.29 seconds. However, 488 of those requests failed due 
to content length mismatches, and only 12 were successful 2xx responses. The server, running 
nginx/1.18.0 on port 80, responded with an average of 388.16 requests per second , with a mean 
time of 128.8 ms per request . Despite the high throughput, the failure rate (97.6%) indicates a 
significant reliability issue, possibly due to incorrect content size verification or resource limitations  
under concurrent load.
C. HTTPS Benchmark – High Load (2000 requests, 200 concurrency)
A secure load test was executed using HTTPS on port 443 ( ab -n 2000 -c 200 
https://<REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>/ ). The test utilized TLSv1.3 with AES_256_GCM_SHA384  encryption and 
X25519 key exchange. Although the test completed all 2000 requests, 1512 requests failed  due to 
content length mismatches. The test ran for about 76.3 seconds, achieving a throughput of 26.22 
requests per second . The median time per request was 7.4 seconds, with the slowest request taking  
up to 9.5 seconds. These results suggest significant overhead introduced by HTTPS, combined with  
server performance degradation under high concurrency.
D. HTTP Benchmark – High Load (2000 requests, 200 concurrency)
Under increased HTTP traffic ( ab -n 2000 -c 200 http://<REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>/ ), the server showed 
substantial instability. Out of 2000 requests, 1982 failed, resulting in only 18 successful 2xx 
responses. The benchmark completed in just over 7.2 seconds, achieving a mean request rate of 
276.29 requests per second . However, the failure rate was over 99%, mainly due to incorrect 
content length, and some requests experienced response times of up to 2.4 seconds. These findings 
indicate the server struggled to handle high concurrent traffic, possibly due to resource bottlenecks 
or misconfigured content handling.
8\n\n--- PAGE 10 ---\nE. Overall Assessment of ApacheBench Results
The ApacheBench tests on the server <REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC> showed significant performance and 
reliability issues under both HTTP and HTTPS traffic. While the server handled low concurrency 
reasonably well in terms of speed, a large number of requests failed due to content-length 
mismatches. Under higher traffic loads, failure rates increased dramatically, especially with HTTPS,  
where average response times reached up to 8 seconds per request. Throughput decreased as 
concurrency rose, and response times varied widely, indicating server strain and possible 
misconfiguration. Overall, the results suggest that the server struggles to maintain stable 
performance under stress, particularly for secure connections. Addressing configuration errors and 
optimizing concurrency handling are essential to improve reliability and scalability.

5.3. Siege
A. Basic HTTP Test (Port 80)
The basic HTTP test on port 80 with 10 concurrent users and 50 repetitions showed very low  
availability of 2.8%. Out of the total requests, 486 failed, indicating significant instability. The 
average response time was 2.42 seconds, which is relatively slow for a basic load test. These results 
suggest that the server has considerable performance issues when handling HTTP traffic on port 80 
even under light load.
B. Basic HTTPS Test (Port 443)
The basic HTTPS test on port 443 using the same concurrency and repetitions achieved 
100% availability with no failed transactions. The server handled 5000 hits with an average 
response time of 0.23 seconds, demonstrating solid and reliable performance for HTTPS 
connections under low load conditions.
9\n\n--- PAGE 11 ---\nC. HTTP Load Test (Port 80)
The HTTP load test on port 80, conducted with 50 concurrent users for one minute, was 
aborted prematurely due to excessive socket failures. Only 10 transactions were successful out of 
over 1000 attempts, resulting in availability below 1%. The response time increased dramatically to 
17.8 seconds, indicating the server was overwhelmed and unable to handle sustained heavy HTTP 
traffic.
D. HTTPS Load Test (Port 443)
The HTTPS load test on port 443 with the same settings completed successfully without 
failures. The server processed 7159 transactions with 100% availability, an average response time of  
0.41 seconds, and a throughput of 6.48 MB/sec. This indicates robust capacity to sustain heavy 
traffic on HTTPS without degradation in performance.
E. Overall Assessment of Siege Results
The performance testing clearly highlights a stark contrast between the server’s handling of 
HTTP and HTTPS traffic. While HTTPS services on port 443 consistently demonstrate high 
availability, fast response times, and stability even under stress, HTTP services on port 80 show 
poor availability, high failure rates, and long response times. This disparity suggests that HTTPS is 
well-optimized and configured on the server, whereas HTTP may require significant attention 
regarding resource allocation, server tuning, or underlying network conditions to improve reliability  
and performance.

6.1.1.  SYN Flood Attack Using hping3(Port 80)
In this project, a SYN Flood attack was performed against the target server (IP: 
<REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>) using the hping3 tool. The attack simulated a Denial of Service (DoS) scenario by 
sending an extremely high volume of TCP SYN packets to the server’s port 80. A total of 1,182,565  
packets were transmitted without receiving any response, indicating a 100% packet loss. This 
demonstrates that the server was overwhelmed by the incoming traffic and was unable to respond to  
legitimate connection attempts. Packet captures via tcpdump and system logs (dmesg) confirmed 
that over a million packets were received and many were dropped due to network congestion. The 
purpose of this attack was to evaluate how the server behaves under SYN flooding and to analyze 
the resulting impact on its performance and availability.
A. HTTPerf Test Results Evaluation
During the SYN Flood attack, the httperf tool was used to measure the server’s ability to 
handle HTTP traffic. The test aimed to make 500 connections at a rate of 50 connections per 
second. However, only 275 requests were issued, and 272 replies were received. The total test 
duration extended to approximately 270 seconds, which reflects severe delays. The average 
connection time was recorded as 12.58 seconds, with a maximum delay reaching up to 36.65 
seconds. Most significantly, the server returned only 37 HTTP 2xx success responses, while 235 
requests resulted in HTTP 5xx server-side errors. Additionally, 225 socket timeout errors occurred. 
These results show that the SYN Flood attack significantly disrupted the server’s ability to handle 
HTTP requests efficiently.
B. ApacheBench Test Results Evaluation
The ApacheBench ( ab) test was conducted with 1000 requests and 50 concurrent 
connections. However, the test failed with the error: “apr_pollset_poll: The timeout specified has 
expired (70007).” This error indicates that the server could not respond in time to the incoming 
connections, likely due to the saturation caused by the SYN Flood attack. ApacheBench is designed 
to evaluate how well a web server performs under load, and its complete failure in this scenario 
highlights the extent of the disruption caused by the attack. It is evident that the attack exhausted 
server resources, making it incapable of handling even a basic benchmark test.
C. Siege Test Results Evaluation
The siege tool was used to simulate 50 concurrent users sending requests to the target server 
for 1 minute. The results showed a mix of HTTP 200 OK and HTTP 503 Service Unavailable 
responses. Numerous connection timeouts occurred, with some requests taking over 19 seconds to 
complete. While some requests did receive successful responses, the majority experienced 
unacceptable delays or failed altogether. The high number of timeouts and 503 errors reflect the 
11\n\n--- PAGE 13 ---\nserver’s inability to maintain availability under heavy SYN Flood traffic. This test reinforces the 
conclusion that the attack had a major negative impact on the server's capacity to serve users 
reliably.
D. Overall Assessment of hping3 SYN Flooding Attack Results
The SYN Flood attack using hping3 had a significant negative impact on the target server’s 
performance and availability. The attack generated over 1.1 million SYN packets, leading to total 
communication breakdown, as evidenced by the 100% packet loss. Packet capture and system logs 
confirmed that the server was receiving and dropping large volumes of traffic. Subsequent testing 
with performance benchmarking tools ( httperf, ab, and siege) showed increased latency, a high 
number of server errors (HTTP 5xx/503), and repeated timeouts. ApacheBench failed entirely, and 
siege showed less than 34% availability. These results clearly demonstrate the server’s vulnerability  
to SYN Flood attacks and underscore the importance of implementing effective mitigation 
strategies such as SYN cookies, connection rate limiting, and robust firewall rules. Without such 
defenses, even a moderate SYN flood can render the server completely unresponsive to legitimate 
users. [17]
6.1.2. SYN Flood Attack Using hping3(Port 443)
The SYN flooding attack conducted using hping3 targeted port 443 of the server at IP 
address <REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>. The attack employed a flood of TCP SYN packets using the --flood 
parameter to generate a high volume of requests per second, overwhelming the server's capacity to 
handle incoming connection attempts. This type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack exploits the TCP 
three-way handshake mechanism by sending numerous SYN packets without completing the 
handshake. The server allocates resources to each half-open connection, eventually leading to 
resource exhaustion. The goal was to degrade or disable HTTPS services by overwhelming the 
server’s TCP backlog queue.
A. Httperf Performance Test
The httperf tool was used to evaluate the server’s responsiveness during the SYN flood. It 
attempted 500 connections at a rate of 50 per second. The results showed a drastically low 
connection rate of only 3.3 connections per second, with a significant average connection time of 
137 ms and a maximum of over 1600 ms. More critically, none of the responses returned a 2xx 
status; instead, 495 out of 498 replies were 4xx errors, showing the server was unable to serve the 
requested resources properly. The CPU utilization was also maxed out, with nearly 100% combined 
user and system time, indicating that the server was overwhelmed. These metrics reflect the severe 
impact of the SYN flooding attack on the server’s ability to handle legitimate HTTPS requests.
B. ApacheBench (ab) Performance Test
ApacheBench was used to simulate 100 HTTPS requests with a concurrency level of 10. 
The test revealed that 68 of the 100 requests failed, all due to response length errors, which 
typically indicate incomplete or malformed replies caused by server instability. The average time 
12\n\n--- PAGE 14 ---\nper request was high at 1796 ms, and the longest request took over 3300 ms to complete. These 
figures suggest that the server was significantly delayed in processing requests, likely due to the 
large number of half-open TCP connections created by the SYN flood. Additionally, the high 
variability in connection and processing times further confirms the instability of the HTTPS service 
during the attack.
C. Siege Performance Test
Using Siege, a more realistic stress test was conducted with 50 concurrent users over a one-
minute duration. The results showed 2,642 successful transactions with only 9 failures, suggesting 
that under specific conditions the server still managed to respond to a portion of requests. However, 
the average response time was high at 0.93 seconds, and the longest response took over 6 seconds. 
The throughput was limited to 2.37 MB/sec, and the average concurrency level hovered around 41. 
These results imply that while some level of availability was maintained, performance was severely 
degraded and the user experience would have been notably poor under actual usage scenarios.
D. Overall Assessment of hping3 SYN Flooding Attack Results
The hping3 SYN flood attack significantly impaired the server's ability to deliver reliable 
and timely HTTPS services on port 443. Across all three performance testing tools— httperf, 
ApacheBench, and Siege—a consistent pattern of high response times, increased failure rates, and 
drastically reduced throughput was observed. The tcpdump results confirmed the delivery of the 
attack traffic and the kernel’s inability to process all incoming packets efficiently. While the server 
did not go entirely offline, its performance was degraded to the point where meaningful 
communication was nearly impossible. These findings emphasize the effectiveness of SYN flooding  
attacks in disrupting web services and underscore the critical need for SYN flood mitigation 
strategies such as SYN cookies, rate limiting, or stateful firewalls.  [18]

6.2. SYN Flood Attack Using Nping(Port 80)
The SYN flooding attack was performed using the nping tool to evaluate how the target 
server (IP: <REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>) handled a high volume of TCP SYN packets on port 80. The command 
used sent 100,000 SYN packets at a rate of 1,000 packets per second. The test revealed that while 
100,000 packets were transmitted, only 9,938 received any form of response, with a packet loss rate  
of 90.06%. This high loss rate indicates that the server either silently dropped the majority of 
incoming SYN requests or responded minimally, suggesting the possible presence of SYN flood 
13\n\n--- PAGE 15 ---\nmitigation mechanisms such as SYN cookies or rate limiting. The round-trip time (RTT) was very 
low, with an average of only 0.014 ms, confirming that the few successful responses occurred 
quickly. Overall, the server was clearly under pressure and rejected most connection attempts.  [19]
A. Httperf Performance Test
The httperf tool was employed to simulate 500 HTTP connections at a steady rate of 50 
requests per second. All connections were successfully initiated; however, the results revealed that 
only 19 requests received a successful 2xx HTTP response. The vast majority, 481 requests, resulted  
in 5xx server errors. This high error rate indicates that although the server was still responsive at the  
TCP level, its application layer was overwhelmed and unable to handle the incoming requests 
properly. The average connection time was 34.5 ms, with a standard deviation of 66.6 ms, reflecting  
inconsistent performance under load. This suggests that the server’s HTTP service became highly 
unstable due to the SYN flooding in the background.
B. ApacheBench (ab) Performance  Test
ApacheBench was used to conduct a quick HTTP benchmarking test with 100 requests at a 
concurrency level of 10. All 100 requests were technically completed, with no failed requests, 
which at first glance might indicate normal operation. However, all responses were non-2xx, 
meaning that the server did not provide valid content for any of the requests. This is another 
indicator that although the server's HTTP service remained online, it was not functioning correctly 
under the SYN flood pressure. The response times remained relatively low (mean time per request: 
35.35 ms), but the server’s failure to return successful HTTP status codes reflects severe 
application-level disruption.
C. Siege Performance Test
The siege tool, configured to simulate 50 concurrent users for a duration of one minute, 
failed almost entirely. Of 1,074 transactions attempted, only one succeeded. The remaining 1,073 
transactions failed, resulting in an availability rate of just 0.09%. The tool reported excessive socket  
failures and aborted the test early. This demonstrates a catastrophic failure in maintaining server 
availability under concurrent access while facing a SYN flood. The average response time was 
reported as 46.37 seconds, further confirming that the server was effectively unreachable or non-
functional during the test.
D. Overall Assessment of Nping SYN Flooding Attack Results
The SYN flooding attack carried out using nping had a substantial and measurable impact 
on the target server. While the server did not completely crash, the performance and availability of 
its web services were significantly degraded across all metrics. Packet loss during the attack was 
extremely high, and the application layer failed to deliver reliable service. Tcpdump confirmed the 
14\n\n--- PAGE 16 ---\ndelivery of attack traffic, ruling out any filtering at the network interface level. Performance testing 
tools such as httperf, ab, and siege demonstrated that the server's ability to respond to HTTP 
requests was severely compromised—producing mostly 5xx errors, non-2xx responses, or complete  
connection failures. These findings highlight the vulnerability of the server under SYN flood 
conditions and underscore the importance of implementing more robust SYN flood defenses and 
traffic management strategies.
6.2..2. SYN Flood Attack Using Nping(Port 443)
The SYN flood attack carried out using nping targeted port 443 of the server 
(<REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>), aiming to overwhelm its ability to manage incoming TCP connections. The attack 
command sudo nping --tcp --flags syn -p 80 --rate 1000 --count 100000 <REDACTED_IP_SPECIFIC>  rapidly sent 
100,000 TCP SYN packets at a rate of 1000 packets per second. This method exploits the TCP 
handshake mechanism, sending numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, thus 
consuming server resources and potentially rendering the service unavailable or degraded for 
legitimate users. This type of attack attempts to exhaust the connection queue and server memory, 
especially if the server continues to wait for acknowledgments that will never arrive.
A. Httperf Performance Test
During the nping SYN flooding attack, the performance of the HTTPS service was 
evaluated using httperf. The test initiated 500 connections at a rate of 50 connections per second. 
Results showed a stable response from the server, with all 500 requests receiving replies. The 
average connection time was 195.3 ms with a connection success rate of 48.1 connections per 
second. Notably, there were no connection failures or timeouts reported, indicating that the server 
was able to handle the traffic despite the SYN flood. However, all responses resulted in HTTP 4xx 
status codes, which could suggest rate limiting or access restrictions triggered by the attack. CPU 
usage was notably high, with 68.2% of processing time spent in system mode, indicating increased 
load handling overhead. This suggests the server was under stress but managed to remain 
responsive.
B. ApacheBench (ab) Performance Test
The ApacheBench (ab) test sent 100 HTTPS requests with a concurrency level of 10. 
Despite the SYN flood in progress, 48 requests were successfully completed while 52 failed, 
primarily due to content-length mismatches. The average request completion time was 
approximately 1019 ms, with a maximum of 2227 ms. These elevated latency values and the 52% 
failure rate indicate moderate service degradation under the stress of the attack. The server still 
responded with valid SSL/TLS parameters and content, suggesting that its core HTTPS service was 
operational, albeit impaired. The results imply partial disruption—enough to degrade service quality  
but not fully deny access.
15\n\n--- PAGE 17 ---\nC. Siege Performance Test
The siege test ran for 1 minute with 50 concurrent users targeting the HTTPS server. Despite  
the ongoing SYN flooding, the server maintained full availability, completing 5732 successful 
transactions with zero failures. The average response time was 0.51 seconds, with a maximum of 
3.54 seconds. This demonstrates a high level of resilience from the server during the attack, 
sustaining a transaction rate of 96.74 requests per second and a throughput of 5.23 MB/sec. These 
figures suggest that while the server was under load, its performance remained relatively 
unaffected, possibly due to internal protections like SYN cookies, connection rate limits, or a well-
tuned kernel. [20]
D. Overall Assessment of Nping SYN Flooding Attack Results
The nping-based SYN flooding attack on port 443 effectively generated a high rate of TCP 
SYN packets intended to exhaust server resources. However, performance tests using httperf, ab, 
and siege indicate that the server demonstrated considerable robustness against this type of attack. 
While ApacheBench exposed some degradation with a high request failure rate and increased 
latency, both httperf and siege tests showed strong performance and near-complete availability. 
These results suggest that the target system was either well-protected against SYN flood attacks or 
operating with sufficient capacity to absorb such traffic. In conclusion, the nping SYN flood caused 
measurable strain but did not succeed in fully compromising the availability or functionality of the 
HTTPS service on the server.

7. Conclusion & Discussion
This study investigated the impact of SYN flooding attacks on the performance and 
availability of the Computer Engineering Department's website at Cukurova University 
(<REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>), specifically targeting ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS). The experiments 
successfully demonstrated the disruptive potential of SYN flooding attacks, while also revealing 
some resilience in the target server's handling of such attacks, particularly on the HTTPS service.
The results from the pre-attack performance testing highlighted a significant disparity in the 
server's ability to handle HTTP and HTTPS traffic on <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>. HTTPS consistently showed 
better performance and stability under load, while HTTP exhibited high error rates and instability, 
16\n\n--- PAGE 18 ---\neven under relatively low traffic conditions. This baseline is critical for understanding the context in  
which the SYN flooding attacks were evaluated against <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>.
During the SYN flooding attacks, both hping3 and nping were effective in degrading the 
server's performance on <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>, although the extent of the impact varied. The hping3 
attacks generally led to more severe disruptions, with increased latency, high error rates, and in 
some cases, complete unresponsiveness of the HTTP service on <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>. Notably, 
ApacheBench failed to complete tests under the hping3 attack on port 80, indicating a complete 
breakdown in the server's ability to handle connections to <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>.
The nping attacks also caused significant packet loss and increased server errors on 
<REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>, but the server demonstrated a degree of resilience, especially on the HTTPS service.  
This suggests the possible presence of SYN flood mitigation mechanisms, such as SYN cookies or 
rate limiting, which helped to maintain some level of service availability for <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>. 
However, even with these potential protections, the server experienced performance degradation, as 
evidenced by increased response times and error rates. [21]
The application layer's instability during attacks on <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>, reflected in the high 
number of 5xx and 4xx errors, is a key finding. While the server might have continued to respond at  
the TCP level, its inability to deliver valid HTTP/HTTPS content highlights the vulnerability of web  
applications to SYN flooding. This underscores the necessity of robust application-level defenses in  
addition to network-level mitigation for <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>.
The ethical considerations and controlled environment of this study are paramount. The 
attacks were conducted with explicit permission and under supervision, ensuring no real harm to the  
target system (<REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>). This approach allowed for valuable insights into the server's 
behavior under stress, contributing to a better understanding of its security posture.
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrated the impact of SYN flooding attacks on 
a real-world web server ( <REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>). The findings emphasize the importance of implementing 
comprehensive defense strategies, including network-level mitigation techniques and application-
level hardening, to ensure the availability and reliability of web services. Further research could 
explore the effectiveness of specific mitigation techniques and the development of more 
sophisticated defense mechanisms against evolving DoS attack vectors for systems like 
<REDACTED_HOSTNAME_SPECIFIC>.
